Materials:
Temperature Sensor: Measures the temperature.
LED: Light-emitting diode to indicate temperature.
Resistor: Used to limit the current to the LED.
Power Supply: Provides voltage for the circuit.
Microcontroller (Arduino): Used for processing the sensor data and controlling the LED.
How It Works:
Temperature Sensor (DS18B20):
The DS18B20 outputs a digital signal, and it does not require an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to interface with a microcontroller or other digital systems.

The temperature sensor continuously measures the temperature of the environment or system it's monitoring.

It can measure temperatures from -55°C to +125°C (−67°F to +257°F), with an accuracy of ±0.5°C in the range of -10°C to +85°C.

The temperature sensor measures the ambient temperature and provides an output voltage proportional to the temperature.

Arduino:
The analog signal from the temperature sensor is read by the Arduino's analog-to-digital converter (ADC).

The microcontroller processes this signal and converts it into a temperature value.

LED:
Based on the processed temperature, the microcontroller can turn the LED on/off or adjust its brightness.

The LED is meant to turn on when a when the temperature exceeds 30 degree Celcius, the microcontroller will switch the LED on.

The LED is connected in series with a current-limiting resistor to prevent it from burning out. The value of the resistor is typically calculated based on the LED's forward voltage and the supply voltage.
